## [Regression modelling project - Report](https://github.com/lolavc/modelling/blob/main/Regression4gh_191223.pdf)
Analyse and explore the Life Expectancy dataset to examine factors that may influence life expectancy across the globe.

**Tasks fulfilled:**
1. Performance of the exploratory analysis: 1.1 Cleaning data, 1.2 Describes statistics, 1.3 Analised correlation between variables, 1.4 Explored multicollinearity, 1.5 Explored outliers, 1.6 Explored linearity, 1.7 Applied transformations to the variables through Tukey's Ladder way
2. Fitting the model: 2.1 Best subset selection, 2.2 Best model selection, 2.3 Checked the assumptions (linearity, normality, constant variance, independence)
3. Analysed the results
