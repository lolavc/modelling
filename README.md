## [Regression modelling project - Report](https://github.com/lolavc/modelling/blob/main/Regression4gh_191223.pdf)
Analyse and explore Life Expectancy dataset to examine factors that may influence life expectancy across the globe.

**Tasks fulfilled:**
1. Performance the exploratory analysis: 1.1 Cleaning data, 1.2 Descriptes statistics, 1.3 Analised correlation betwween variables, 1.4 Explored multicollinearity, 1.5 Explored outliers, 1.6 Explored linearity, 1.7 Applied transformation to the variables through Tukey's Ladder way

2. Fitting the model: 2.1 Best subset selection, 2.2 Best model selection, 2.3 Checked the assumptions (linearity, normality, constant variance, independence)
   
3. Analised the results
