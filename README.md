## [Regression modelling project - Report](https://github.com/lolavc/modelling/blob/main/Regression4gh_191223.pdf)
This report details the process of analysing and exploring the Life Expectancy dataset to examine factors that may influence life expectancy across the globe.

### Tasks Completed:
<b>1. Exploratory Analysis:</b>  
1.1 Data Cleaning: The dataset underwent cleaning procedures to ensure data quality.  
1.2 Descriptive Statistics: Descriptive statistics were computed to gain insights into the distribution of variables.  
1.3 Correlation Analysis: The correlation between variables was analyzed to identify potential relationships.  
1.4 Multicollinearity Exploration: Multicollinearity among variables was explored to assess potential issues.  
1.5 Outlier Detection: Outliers in the data were identified and examined for their impact on the analysis.  
1.6 Linearity Assessment: The linearity between variables was explored to ensure the appropriateness of regression models.  
1.7 Variable Transformations: Transformations were applied to variables using Tukey's Ladder method to meet model assumptions.  

<b>2. Model Fitting:</b>  
2.1 Best Subset Selection: Various subsets of predictors were considered to identify the best combination for model fitting.  
2.2 Model Selection: The best model was selected based on criteria such as model fit and interpretability.  
2.3 Assumption Checking: Assumptions including linearity, normality, constant variance, and independence were assessed to ensure the validity of the model.  

<b>3. Results Analysis:</b>  
The results of the regression model were analyzed to interpret the relationships between variables and their impact on life expectancy.

These tasks aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing life expectancy worldwide and to develop an effective regression model for predicting life expectancy based on the dataset variables.
